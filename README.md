Hello:

This is a draft Cryptocoin framework plugin for Sourcemod.  

Its purpose is to provide sourcemod plugins with hooks into cryptocoin 
digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Feathercoin, and others. 

My reasons for developing this plugin are mainly out of curiosity with how
P2P electronic currencies can be integrated with games supported by
Sourcemod. 

Goals of this API include:
 * Connecting Sourcemod to a Cryptocoin "wallet" via jsonrpc for management
   of addresses and player transactions through call backs
 * Providing support functions for 3rd party plugins to send, receive and
   check status and balances of players game server balances.
 * Have fun experimenting with digital currency
